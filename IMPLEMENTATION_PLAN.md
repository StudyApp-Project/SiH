# 📋 EduWrap — Implementation Plan

## Current Status

**What exists today:**
- React 19 + Vite 8 project (working)
- React Router DOM 7 routing (working)
- CSS Modules styling replaced entirely with Tailwind CSS v4
- Lucide React icons (keep)
- 4 pages built: Landing, Dashboard, Rooms, StudyRoom (will be rebuilt)
- UserContext with localStorage persistence (keep pattern, expand)
- Theme system and Accent system active
- Completed Phases 0 through 4 (Foundation, Design System, UI Components, App Shell, Landing)

**Important Architecture Notes for AI Agents:**
1. **Tailwind v4 Variables:** We strictly use Tailwind v4 arbitrary syntax. DO NOT use `bg-[var(--bg-elevated)]`. YOU MUST USE `bg-(--bg-elevated)`. All CSS variables map natively in v4 using parentheses.
2. **Global Specificity:** A `@layer base` wrapper is used in `index.css` to prevent `* { margin: 0 }` from overriding Tailwind utilities. If you write custom CSS, always put it in a `@layer`.
3. **Animations:** We heavily use `framer-motion`. For any blurred or heavy animation, always attach `will-change-transform transform-gpu` to the `className`.
4. **Data Persistence:** Because there is no backend, every single interactive phase MUST use React Context combined with `localStorage` so data persists across reloads.
5. **UI Aesthetic:** Premium SaaS. Use glassmorphism (`bg-(--bg-glass) backdrop-blur-md`), deep shadows, and subtle gradients. Avoid flat, boring designs.

The Dashboard is the home page of the logged-in experience. It aggregates data from the other modules (Study Rooms, Notes, Quizzes) and displays it beautifully using Bento-grid layouts and interactive charts.

**Core Components to Build:**
- `WelcomeHeader.jsx`: Personalized greeting based on time of day, displaying the user's current streak.
- `StatCard.jsx`: Glassmorphic cards for displaying high-level metrics (XP, level).

- `LeaderboardMini.jsx`: A small tabular view of top students.

**State Management (`DashboardContext` or Mock Data):**
- Create mock arrays for `recentActivities`, `upcomingSessions`, and `analyticsData`.
- Use `UserContext` for XP and streak.

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Animated number count-ups for stats (e.g., jumping from 0 to 500 XP smoothly).
- Hover interactions on cards that slightly lift them `hover:-translate-y-1` and increase shadow `hover:shadow-(--shadow-glow)`.

### ✅ PHASE 7 — Study Room System (CORE — DONE)
> **Goal:** The heart of EduWrap. Discord + Notion + Google Classroom architecture.

**Understanding & Instructions:**
This is the most complex phase. A "Room" contains multiple "Classrooms" (like Discord servers containing channels). You need to build a discovery page to find rooms, a creation modal to make new ones, and the actual Room Layout which includes a dedicated left sidebar for navigation and a right sidebar for members/chat.

**Core Components to Build:**

    → Phase 2 (UI Components)
      → Phase 3 (App Shell)
        → Phase 4 (Landing)
        → Phase 5 (Auth)
        → Phase 6 (Dashboard)
        → Phase 7 (Study Rooms) ← CORE, largest
          → Phase 8 (Chat)
          → Phase 9 (Notes)
          → Phase 10 (Flashcards)
          → Phase 11 (Quiz)
          → Phase 12 (Video Call)
          → Phase 13 (Doubts)
          → Phase 14 (Files)
